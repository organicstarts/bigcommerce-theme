    <div class="ui segment p-2 p-lg-4">
        <p>It all began after our founders Peter and Pennie proudly became parents of triplets. Their newborns were constantly fussy, colicky, sleeping uncomfortably - all in all, basically unhappy babies. Being healthy, diet aware parents themselves, Peter decided to start research on the formulas they were feeding their babies. What they discovered was astonishing! The ingredients (in formulas which are made in the United States) were something an adult should not consume themselves, let alone a one month old baby! </p>
        <p>They scoured the internet for the healthiest alternative but struggled to find a solution. Almost every so-called top “organic” formula was full of hidden ingredients. “Why would we ever feed our children anything with ingredients not even close to organic?”</p>
        <p>After looking everywhere to try and find a reliable source sold in the U.S., they stumbled upon certain brands of European formula that were highly recommended and praised by parents online. They imported a couple boxes of formula and fed it to their triplets. What happened next was a miracle. They were no longer colicky but also content and slept straight through each night! Happy, peaceful and joyful - the way babies should be. They called it their “miracle formula” - a potion of happiness!</p>
