To our United States customers – we are sorry to inform you that Organic Start is no longer selling baby formula, due to regulatory issues in the United States. We know that this comes as a disappointment to you and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. While these formulas meet rigorous EU quality standards, the importation of these products may not comport with U.S. regulations. We understand that this may be difficult for those of you who have relied on these products. As you may know, Organic Start offers a wide array of other all-natural, organic products and we will continue to provide those options. Your business and loyalty are important to us and we hope to continue to be a resource in meeting your family’s needs.
