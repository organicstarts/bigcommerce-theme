        <p>Orders are shipped Monday through Saturday from our primary fulfillment center in North Las Vegas, Nevada. In the suburban outskirts of Vegas we gain access to new talent and create career opportunities for neighborhoods in the quickly growing area. This location is perfect for storage and operations with sufficient storage space and ideal weather conditions.</p>
        <h6>Cutoff Times</h6>
        <p><strong>Monday through Friday:</strong> Before 3 PM (PST)</p>
        <p><strong>Saturdays:</strong> Before 2 PM (PST)</p>
        <p>We take great pride in our fast turnaround time with most orders shipping within only a couple of hours after being placed. All orders placed before cutoff times are guaranteed to ship same day. All orders placed after our cutoff time will ship the following business day. Therefore, orders placed after 2 PM (PST) on Saturday will be shipped Monday.</p>
        <h6>Tracking</h6>
        <p>You will be notified with a tracking number once your order has been processed and shipped. Tracking may not be immediately active until your package is received by a local facility.</p>
        <h6>Large Orders</h6>
        <p>In some rare cases, larger orders are shipped using FedEx Ground or FedEx Home Delivery. These orders may take an additional day or two to arrive. We do this to ensure larger orders are handled with care.</p>
        <h6>Holidays</h6>
        <p>Orders are prepared but do not ship during publicly observed federal holidays in the United States. Orders will be shipped the following business day. Please plan and prepare in advance as orders around this time will likely be subject to delays (anticipate severe delays around shopping holidays such as Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday). We've listed the most important holidays below:</p>
